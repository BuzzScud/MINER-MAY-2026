# Project Organization Summary

This document summarizes the project reorganization that was completed to improve structure and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization
All documentation files have been organized into logical subdirectories:

- **`docs/deployment/`** - All deployment-related documentation
  - DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
  - DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_TRADING.md
  - SUBDIRECTORY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
  - URGENT_FIX.md
  - UPTIMEKIT_SETUP.md

- **`docs/debugging/`** - Debugging and troubleshooting guides
  - DEBUGGING_FIX.md
  - DEBUGGING_SETUP.md
  - FIXES_APPLIED.md

- **`docs/development/`** - Development documentation
  - PRODUCTION_READINESS.md

- **`docs/integration/`** - Integration guides (consolidated from root)
  - INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
  - FORMULAS_REFERENCE.md

- **`docs/`** (root) - General documentation
  - FORMULA_REFINEMENTS.md
  - PRIME_TOWER_UPDATE.md
  - PROJECTION_IMPROVEMENTS.md
  - README.md (documentation index)

- **`docs/assets/`** - Documentation assets
  - continue-proceeding-forward.pdf

### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `config/` directory for server configuration files
  - Moved `nginx.conf` to `config/nginx.conf`

### 3. Archive Organization
- Created `archive/old-workspaces/` directory
  - Moved `_workspace_fibonacci-calculator-final/` to archive
  - Moved `ALGO-1-APACHE-READY/` to archive
  - Removed duplicate archive folder

### 4. Scripts Organization
- `scripts/` directory already existed and is properly organized
  - `update-htaccess.js` - Post-build script

### 5. Source Code Structure
The `src/` directory is organized as follows:
- `components/` - Reusable components, grouped by feature:
  - `common/` - ErrorBoundary and shared UI
  - `grid/` - GridGenerator, GridControls, GridPreview, GridCodeOutput
  - `monitor/` - MonitorCard, MonitorChart, AddMonitorModal
  - `sidebar/` - Sidebar, SidebarClock, UserProfile
  - `calendar/` - EconomicCalendarWidget
- `pages/` - Page components
- `services/` - API services
- `layouts/` - Layout components
- `styles/` - Page-specific styles
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `assets/` - Static assets

### 6. Scripts Consolidation (Latest)
- Moved `deploy.sh` and `server-fix.sh` from project root to `scripts/`.
- Deploy from project root: `./scripts/deploy.sh`. The script changes to project root internally.
- Updated `docs/deployment/URGENT_SERVER_FIX.md` to reference `scripts/deploy.sh`.
- Fixed deploy script to look for compiled JS in `dist/assets/` (Vite output) instead of `dist/js/`.

## File Locations

### Root Level Files (Intentionally Left)
These files remain in the root for standard project structure:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Lock file
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration
- `index.html` - Entry HTML file
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration (must be in root)
- `public/.htaccess` - Public Apache configuration
- `README.md` - Main project README
- `LICENSE` - License file

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Related files are grouped together
2. **Easier Navigation**: Clear directory structure makes finding files easier
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory is cleaner with only essential files
4. **Better Maintainability**: Logical grouping makes maintenance easier
5. **Clear Documentation**: Documentation is categorized and indexed

## Migration Notes

- All file references in code remain valid (no code changes needed)
- Documentation links may need updating if referenced elsewhere
- Build scripts continue to work as before
- No breaking changes to the application

## Next Steps

When referencing documentation:
- Use paths relative to `docs/` directory
- Check `docs/README.md` for documentation index
- Update any external links to documentation files
